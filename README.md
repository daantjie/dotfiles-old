My OLD dotfiles
===========

You should be looking at [my new dotfiles.](https://github.com/danieloosthuizen/dotfiles)


These are my personal dotfiles; you are very welcome to peruse
them, and take from them what you wish. However, I give no
guarantee that anything in this repo works!

Warning!
--------

Since I have transitioned from vim to emacs (thanks to EVIL),
I will no longer be updating those config files. Sorry!

Quick install
-------------

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danieloosthuizen/dotfiles.git &
cd dotfiles &
./install.sh
```

**Warning:** untested.
